Plant Protection continues to play a significant role in achieving targets of crops production.Plant Protection The major thrust areas of plant protection are promotion of Integrated Pest management, ensuring availability of safe and quality pesticides for sustaining crop production from the ravages of pests and diseases, streamlining the quarantine measures for accelerating the introduction of new high yielding crop varieties, besides eliminating the chances of entry of exotic pests and for human resource development including empowerment of women in plant protection skills.

Processes like desertification, erosion, the decline in organic matter in soil, soil contamination (e.g. by heavy metals), soil compaction and salinity can reduce the ecological state and, thereby, the productive capacity of soil.

Such degradation can result from inappropriate farming practices such as unbalanced fertilisation, the excessive use of groundwater for irrigation, improper use of pesticides, use of heavy machinery, or overgrazing.

Other causes of soil degradation include the abandonment of certain farming practices. For example greater specialisation towards arable farming has frequently meant an end of traditional crop rotation systems and fertilising with green legumes (working these plants into the soil), practices that helped restore the organic matter content of soil.
